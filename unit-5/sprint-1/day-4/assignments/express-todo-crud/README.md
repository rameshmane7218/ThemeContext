## Todo List with Redux and Express

- I have updated todo list app which is given in Sprint evaluation 1.
- Along with that I also used **Redux** to do all operations like, `Add Task` `Increment and Decrement Counter` `Delete Task` `Update Status`.

- By doing this overall code lines are reduced and it look clean.

- **Express** is used to handle backend side of todo.

## Set-up to run code on system

**Start react app**

    npm start

**run server file (run express)**

    npm run dev

    (or)

    nodemon server.js
