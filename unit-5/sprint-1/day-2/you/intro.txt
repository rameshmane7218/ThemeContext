Node - JS (rehan) 
JS is sync,
event driven,
single threaded language
    - two function will not run at one time 
    - It will run one by one that means it is single threaded language
    - java,c, c++ is multi threaded language.

JS is sync - but to some extent: 
JS behaves asynchronous -> 
    - callback function  
        - fun which is passed as an argument to otehr function 

    - HOF function 
        - function which accept callback function as an argument
