## Todo List with use Reducer

- I have updated todo list app which is given in Sprint evaluation 1.
- Earlier at the time of evaluation we have used props drilling techniques to pass props from one component to another
- To overcome this I have used Context API
- Along with that I also used useReducer to do all operations like, `Add Task` `Increment and Decrement Counter` `Delete Task` `Update Status`.

- By doing this overall code lines are reduced and it look clean.
